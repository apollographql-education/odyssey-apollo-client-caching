# Apollo Client: Caching

Welcome to the starter code for the Odyssey course, [Apollo Client: Caching](https://www.apollographql.com/tutorials/apollo-client-caching). In this course, we'll explore the various features of the Apollo Client cache. We'll use type policies, client-only fields, and the built-in caching APIs to read and manipulate data directly in the cache.

## Getting started

Clone this repository, then open a new terminal to the root of the project.

First, install dependencies.

```
npm install
```

Next, boot up the app.

```
npm start
```

This starts up the app, which you can browse and play around with at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

### Install extensions


### Install Google Chrome browser extensions

Throughout the course, we'll be using [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/intl/en_ca/chrome/dr/download/) along with a few helpful browser extensions to support our client development

- [Apollo Client
    DevTools](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/apollo-client-devtools/jdkknkkbebbapilgoeccciglkfbmbnfm)
    to help us explore the cache.
- [React
    DevTools](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/react-developer-tools/fmkadmapgofadopljbjfkapdkoienihi?hl=en)
    to help us examine the React component tree.


With that, you're good to go! See you on Odyssey.
